# oggm_mb_sandbox_option_intercomparison

scripts to reproduce figures and analysis of Schuster et al. (2023, in review, submitted to Annals of Glaciology). We uploaded the preprint to EarthArXiv, and it is available under the DOI https://doi.org/10.31223/X5C65S .

The scripts work together with [OGGM_v153](https://github.com/OGGM/oggm/releases/tag/v1.5.3) and this [OGGM massbalance-sandbox commit](https://github.com/OGGM/massbalance-sandbox/tree/918a229e175220d22d53c1d5a0b92ea784ef5b1d). 

- In `00_data_creating_scripts/`, you can find the scripts to create the data and to postprocess them. The actual data is publicly available via Zenodo: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7660887

- In `analysis_notebooks/`, you can find all the juypter notebooks that were used to create figures for the paper and the supplementary material. There are also some additional plots and analysis that were used to do statements without figures in the text.
